# RedditFlairBot
## About
This was an old script that was written to streamline reddit moderation duties. The user would
enter their information into a form which would be sent to this script's account. The script would
take that information, cross check it with another subreddit (which contained player history) and 
would then assign the user the appropriate user flair. 

This script is a few years old and is out of commision. I have uploaded it here as an example for
anyone trying to create a Python Reddit script.'
